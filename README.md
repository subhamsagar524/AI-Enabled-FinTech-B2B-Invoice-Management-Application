# AI-Enabled FinTech B2B Invoice Management Application

## Problem Statement
#### The buyer business needs to clear its amount due before the due date. However, in real-world scenarios , the invoices are not always cleared ie. paid in full amount by the due date. The date on which a customer clears the payment for an invoice is called the payment date.

## What is available?
#### A dataset over 5 millions rows of data having information about invoices such as business_code, currency, different dates like invoice create date, due date, ID, and name of the company.

## Goal
#### 1. To build a Machine Learning Model to predict the payment date of an invoice when it gets created in the system.
#### 2. To build a full-stack Invoice Management Application consisting of a receivables dashboard capable of visualizing data and perform add, edit, delete and search operations on the invoices.
